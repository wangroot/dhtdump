#### bittorrent DHT info

A dump from bittorrent's DHT network, no content, just metadata.

I created this dump to help the security community track and analyze all kinds
of malware and trojans that might be potentially included in files shared via
torrent protocol, and to track down leaks resulting from data breaches.

This dump can also be used by copyright owners to see if their copyright is
being infringed upon. Most torrent sites don't show full information about what
is shared via torrent protocol and this dump can help to discover also files
that are actively shared, but weren't placed on popular torrent sharing sites.

This is just a dump from DHT network. Everyone who connects to DHT network can
see all the information presented here and more. If you think some hash value
shouldn't be presented here, please track down the IP addresses putting the
content on the DHT network and force them to stop doing that. After that the
hash will automatically be excluded from this list.


#### file structure

Tab separated columns:

info hash	unique torrent fingerprint
files		number of files in the torrent
total size	total torrent data size in MB
name		name of the torrent


#### usage

This repository is updated hourly. There is also a version that is updated daily
and includes a little bit more information:
https://github.com/bittorrentdht/dhtdump-with-dates

To search for potentially malicious ubuntu images just type e.g.:
$ grep -hi 'ubuntu.*20\.04' hash-*.tsv

To be able to search for malware fingerprints you can do something like this:
$ transmission-remote -a magnet:?xt=urn:btih:<hash_value>


#### other

I hope this repository will make the world a safer place.
